Abstract:
In our project, our goal is to utilize a BERT-based model in order to iden-
tify and filter out spam messages from emails, social media, or other types of
communication. We believe that BERT has potential to be used for bidirec-
tional encodings and allow for greater ability to distinguish between spam and
non-spam. In our project, we will first tokenize the sentences using the BERT
embeddings, converting them into numerical inputs which can be fed into the
BERT model. Eventually, we plan to used a fine-tuned BERT model in a su-
pervised learning approach on the training dataset. The hope is that eventually
we can evaluate on the model on the held-out test set and achieve good results
using the BERT model.
